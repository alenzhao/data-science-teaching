Introducing the dataset
************************

This is not a text on biology, genomics or bioinformatics. But we will
be using a population genomics dataset, hence we will introduce some
necessary concepts. The text will be kept to a bare minimum with links
to further explanations (as a rule the English version of Wikipedia
is a great port of call).
