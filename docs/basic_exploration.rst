Basic exploration

.. note::
  Notebooks:

  * Metadata_
  * Basic_Exploration_


Here we are going to inspect that dataset along with the metadata.

.. warning::
    The point here is just a basic introduction to the data. The metadata
    part can be instructive (pandas based), but we will not delve here into
    explaing the code that does the data exploration. That is the subject
    of the next chapters. Do not worry if you do not understand the HDF5 code
    as we will get to it.
