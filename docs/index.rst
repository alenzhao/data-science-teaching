Data Science with Python
###########################

This course is intended to get you up to speed with modern programming
techniques and statistical concepts related to Data Science and Big Data.

While these are fashionable buzzwords nowadays there is some very interesting
and applicable concepts behind them.

While we use bioinformatics as an example here, the content is readily
applicable to most other data science fields.

This course is mostly Python based, but it will use Javascript (browser)
for visualization. We also discuss interfacing with R and speed optimizations
using Cython.

You can look at this course from 3 different perspectives:

* As a hands-on example from where you can take very practical ideas to
  apply directly to your work

* As an advanced course in the Python ecosystem of libraries and frameworks
  for data science. And a little bit of the Javascript/browser side

* As a presentation of the concepts behind advanced programming techniques for
  data science (data management, asynchronous programming, map-reduce
  frameworks, high-performance computing, ...)
